# Contributing capabilities to the Rubin Science Platform

```{abstract}
The Rubin Science Platform is a coherent ecosystem of integrated services operated (and in most cases developed) by the Data Services division of Rubin Data Management. 

It is possible for second-party (wider Rubin, beyond Data Services) and third-party (external groups) to contribute capabilities for the benefit of all Rubin Science Platform users. 

This document outlines the policies and process for such contributions.
